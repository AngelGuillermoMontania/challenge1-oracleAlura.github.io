## **Recommendation:** 
Run **Live Server** or similar in the corresponding html

### **An application that encrypts texts.**


The encryption "keys" that we will use are the following:

`The letter "e" is converted to "enter"`
`The letter "i" is converted to "imes"`
`The letter "a" is converted to "ai"`
`The letter "o" is converted to "ober"`
`The letter "u" is converted to "ufat"`

**Requirements:**
- It should be possible to convert a word to the encrypted version as well as return an encrypted word to its original version. 

Example:
`"gato" => "gaitober"`
`gaitober" => "gato"`

- The page must have fields for
insertion of the text to be encrypted or decrypted, and the user must be able to choose between the two options.
- The result should be displayed on the screen.

**Additional features:**
- A button that copies the encrypted/decrypted text for the transfer section, i.e. has the same functionality as `ctrl+C` or the "copy" option in the applications menu.
